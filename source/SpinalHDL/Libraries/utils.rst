       |  ohPriority : Bits
       | )
     - Bits
     - | Apply a mask on x to only keep the bit set from ``requests``.
       | it start looking in ``requests`` from the ``ohPriority`` position.
       | For example if ``requests`` is "1001" and ``ohPriority`` is "0010", the ``roundRobin`` function will start looking in `requests` from its second bit and will return "1000".
   * - | `MuxOH <http://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalHDL/#spinal.lib.MuxOH$>`_ (
       |   oneHot : IndexedSeq[Bool],
       |   inputs : Iterable[T]
       | )
     - T
     - Returns the muxed ``T`` from the ``inputs`` based on the ``oneHot`` vector.

       |    sel: Seq[Bool],
       |    in:  Seq[T]
       | )
     - T
     - Return the first ``in`` element whose ``sel`` is ``True``.
   * - | PriorityMux (
       |    in:  Seq[(Bool, T)]
       | )

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 3 1 5

   * - Syntax
     - Return
     - Description
   * - Delay(that: T, cycleCount: Int)
     - T
     - Return ``that`` delayed by ``cycleCount`` cycles
   * - History(that: T, length: Int[,when : Bool])
     - List[T]
     - | Return a Vec of ``length`` elements
       | The first element is ``that``\ , the last one is ``that`` delayed by ``length``\ -1\
       | The internal shift register sample when ``when`` is asserted
   * - BufferCC(input : T)
     - T
     - Return the input signal synchronized with the current clock domain by using 2 flip flop


Counter
^^^^^^^

The Counter tool can be used to easily instanciate an hardware counter.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1

   * - Instanciation syntax
     - Notes
   * - Counter(start: BigInt, end: BigInt[, inc : Bool])
     - 
   * - Counter(range : Range[, inc : Bool])
     - Compatible with the  ``x to y`` ``x until y`` syntaxes
   * - Counter(stateCount: BigInt[, inc : Bool])
     - Start at zero and finish at ``stateCount - 1``
   * - Counter(bitCount: BitCount[, inc : Bool])
     - Start at zero and finish at ``(1 << bitCount) - 1``


There is an example of different syntaxes which could be used with the Counter tool

.. code-block:: scala

   val counter = Counter(2 to 9)  //Create a counter of 10 states (2 to 9)
   counter.clear()            //When called it ask to reset the counter.
   counter.increment()        //When called it ask to increment the counter.
   counter.value              //current value
   counter.valueNext          //Next value
   counter.willOverflow       //Flag that indicate if the counter overflow this cycle
   counter.willOverflowIfInc  //Flag that indicate if the counter overflow this cycle if an increment is done
   when(counter === 5){ ... }

When a ``Counter`` overflow its end value, it restart to its start value.

.. note::
   Currently, only up counter are supported.

Timeout
^^^^^^^

The Timeout tool can be used to easily instanciate an hardware timeout.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1

   * - Instanciation syntax
     - Notes
   * - Timeout(cycles : BigInt)
     - Tick after ``cycles`` clocks
   * - Timeout(time : TimeNumber)
     - Tick after a ``time`` duration
   * - Timeout(frequency : HertzNumber)
     - Tick at an ``frequency`` rate


There is an example of different syntaxes which could be used with the Counter tool

.. code-block:: scala

   val timeout = Timeout(10 ms)  //Timeout who tick after 10 ms
   when(timeout){                //Check if the timeout has tick
       timeout.clear()           //Ask the timeout to clear its flag
   }

.. note::
   If you instanciate an ``Timeout`` with an time or frequency setup, the implicit ``ClockDomain`` should have an frequency setting.

ResetCtrl
^^^^^^^^^

The ResetCtrl provide some utilities to manage resets.

asyncAssertSyncDeassert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter an asynchronous reset by using an asynchronously asserted synchronously deaserted logic. To do it you can use the ``ResetCtrl.asyncAssertSyncDeassert`` function which will return you the filtred value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1 4

   * - Argument name
     - Type
     - Description
   * - input
     - Bool
     - Signal that should be filtered
   * - clockDomain
     - ClockDomain
     - ClockDomain which will use the filtered value
   * - inputPolarity
     - Polarity
     - HIGH/LOW (default=HIGH)
   * - outputPolarity
     - Polarity
     - HIGH/LOW (default=clockDomain.config.resetActiveLevel)
   * - bufferDepth
     - Int
     - Number of register stages used to avoid metastability (default=2)


There is also an ``ResetCtrl.asyncAssertSyncDeassertDrive`` version of tool which directly assign the ``clockDomain`` reset with the filtred value.
